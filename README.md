# A-MATHEMATICAL-MODEL-FOR-THE-MELT-SPINNING-OF-POLYMER-FIBERS

* Using the concept of partial differential equations (PDEs) and Python we build a math model for fiber melt process.
* objective is to analyze the influence of gravity on our model.
* we utilized Python libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and SciPy.
